            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>HItherto the endeavours of both King, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and Subiects, have been to redreſſe thoſe evils, and expulſe ſuch pernitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes as have been endeavoured againſt us by the malignant party of this Kingdome; which although never ſo ſedulous and vigilant, yet have the dangers by them invented, alwayes found a repercuſſion upon their owne heads, through the care of this State-governing Parliament, and although they have bene very diligent in ſowing weeds of diviſions amongſt us; yet our worthy Gardiners have puld them up by the roots, that the Flowers of Religion, loyalty, faith and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, might flouriſh, through the removall of our adverſaries, ſith that our diſconſolate cares <pb facs="tcp:112631:3"/>have been ſo invoked to provide for reſiſtance of theſe aforeſaid evils, how welcome and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable would the newes of a remedy be? The Cite that ſo long hath been troubled, frighted and perturbed with civill commotions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible dangers, how would it ſhew forth the garlands of good will, the Plumes of Peace, and Enſignes of Loyalty, upon ſo happy an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration? How would the Proteſtant reioyce, and as it were bee involved in gladneſſe, to ſee the Papiſts and their hereticall adherents, either converted or aſhamed? Such is the newes I meane to treat on, ſo happy as it goes beyond expreſſion to nominate, and as reall as it ſeemes happy. Theſe grievances have principally been inverted upon us by his Maieſties diſagreeing with the Parliament, by the perſwaſions of ſome who were but ſeeming wel-wiſhers to the State. To change theſe occaſions of ſorrow into hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, His Maieſty hath beene pleaſed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the manifold inconveniences that hee might incurre upon his Kingdome and himſelfe, by loſing the affections of his Subiects, by this ſo ominous accounted diſſeveration, hath been ſince graciouſly pleaſed to unite himſelfe with all alacrity and of his owne free-will with them for the conſummation of his Subiects good ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

            <pb facs="tcp:112631:3"/>
            <p>That whereas the continuall perturbance of the times had proved grievous and burdenſome unto him, in reſpect of the converſant commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ariſing through his Non-reſidence with them at London, his Maieſty was reſowed for a ſpeedy returne, thereby to confiſcate and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh theſe their ſorrowes: As alſo that his hopes of and concerning this gracious meſſage on Munday, being the fourteenth of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary laſt, ſhould have produced ſome ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as by offering what was fit on their parts to doe: as alſo for this Maieſty to granr, might beget a mutuall confidence in each other; His Maieſty therefore further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that thoſe his good hopes might not bee fruſtrated, and ſo his endeavours prove vaine and to no purpoſe; but rather that they would with ſedulous diligence labour to ſtrengthen and enable them any way to debilitate or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ſame reciprocall coniunction, or mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all laborious co-operation.</p>
            <p>And furthermore, foraſmuch as this his Kingdom of England was very much diſtreſſed, &amp; in continuall fear through the want of exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed force (though for ſouldier there bee ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, &amp; by reaſon that his Maties chiefe Fortreſſes towards the ſea-coaſts were unfortified, &amp; ſo the leſſe able to make reſiſtance againſt invaſion, they having manifeſted as much unto his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, &amp; in care of his Realme, and preſervation of <pb facs="tcp:112631:4"/>the ſecure peace and tranquility of his ſubiects. Hee Royally deſired that the preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would ſpeedily ſet about, and expeditiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrive a remedy; and hee in that, as in all other reaſonable motions, as farre as might ſtand with his Honour, would mutually ioyne in aſſiſtance towardes the rectifying of the ſame.</p>
            <p>As for the Petitions of ſeverall Counties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered and humbly preferred to the Parliament, for the reliefe of theſe and other ſuch like grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of his Kingdome, moſt eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the grounds of Proteſtant Religion; which hath been abuſed, and little ſet by, ſince the Biſhops introducing, bringing in, and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly maintaining, contrary to the conſciences, of the well-affected Proteſtants, of ſuperſtitious and Papiſticall ceremonies, his Maieſty was graciouſly pleaſed with zeale and firme devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the truth, to importune a reformation of the ſame, thereby to gaine his ſubiects love and affection, and procure them ſo long-look'd for and ever to be deſired peace.</p>
            <p>To the which end, <hi>Wren,</hi> and the other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops found tardy, and to be delinquents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this occaſion in and againſt the ſafety of the State, and propagaring of Religion, that ſeeing they were found guilty, and the matter of ſo high conſequence (as concerning their cenſure, it was ordered) that they being the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans

            <p>Thus was the Vnity begun, which wee daily pray to continue.</p>
